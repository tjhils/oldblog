  <h1 class="post-title">Better Late Than Never</h1>
  <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2014</span>
  <p>4 years ago as an IT support intern at a small pharmaceutical company I decided that I was going to learn how to code. I sat down and made a spreadsheet of the most popular programming languages and the best online free courses for each one. Every day I would sit down at my computer with a fresh cup of coffee and pluck away at a few more exercises and try to learn just a little bit more.</p>

<p>4 years and as many half-completed courses later, I still didn&#39;t know how to code. No longer a bright-eyed, pimply-faced-youth at a small company I&#39;ve been transplated into a fast-paced startup surrounded by some of the brightest people I&#39;ve ever met. Each of them has more programming talent in their little toes than I have in my whole body and its sparked in me a renewed comittment to learning to code.</p>

<p>This time I around I decided that I was willing to invest whatever it takes in learning a new skill and that has meant making learning to code a high priority in my life. Its also meant being honest with myself and my learning style. With that in mind I sought out a course with a strong teacher to help steer me and help make up for any shortcomings in my own discipline.</p>

<p>After a lengthy search I settled on <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc&#39;s</a> frontend web development apprenticeship.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the amount of time set aside for 1-on-1 interaction with your mentor, something I feel is pivotal to my ability to learn, and their rigorous curriculum that reflected the real life tools a developer needs to function. I&#39;ve been working on this course for almost two weeks and already I feel like I&#39;ve learned more than I had in my self-study.</p>

<p>So far I&#39;m squashed the basics of JavaScript, learned to conquer Git and even deployed a small site to Heroku. While I&#39;ve often felt frustrated with some of the exercises its taught me to seek out answers aggressively and to put together solutions with all the tools available to me. I&#39;ve still got 16 weeks ahead of me and a lot to learn but I hope to keep this blog updated with my progress and, hopefully, projects!</p>
