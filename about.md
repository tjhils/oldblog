<p class="message">
  This is a blog about my experiences learning to code in the hopes of someday becoming a frontend developer. It is full of ups and downs, and possibly even some lefts and rights. So buckle in and watch my journey unfold.

My name is Thomas Hils and I work for [Action Verb](www.actionverb.com) where I do sales and support for [BrickFTP](www.brickftp.com) and [Vae platform](www.vaeplatform.com). You can find me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/tjhils).

I've worked with computers in some capacity since college and I'm looking to make a pivot from support into web development. I'm currently participating in a frontend development apprenticeship through [Bloc.io](www.bloc.io) and this blog will be both a longform review of the apprenticeship as well as a journal of my evolution as a developer. Hopefully it'll be useful both for those looking to learn to code and those specically interested in starting an apprenticeship with Bloc.
